MTOTD Home Automation

Must have 1 RaspberryPi master (MTOTD-PiMaster) and can have multiple RaspberryPi slaves (MTOTD-PiSlaves) or other devices that can be controlled manually (Arduino, IoT switch, …)

RaspberryPi Master will contain a web interface to Manage the whole system and a MySQL database to store the zone/sensor/object/scheduling/events/… data.  RaspberryPi Master can also function as a slave if there are objects associated with it.  The RaspberryPi slave will run a flask webserver used to trigger GPIO/SPI/... events when the appropriate JSON data is sent to it.
